```

The penguins dataset has 8 columns and 344 rows. There are 8 variables which are species, island, bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper_length (mm), body mass (grams), sex, and year. Species, island, and sex are factor variables while the rest are numeric. The dataset includes 3 penguin species, 3 different islands, and two sexes across years 2007 to 2009. 

The mean flipper length within the penguins dataset is 200.9152 mm.
